## 🧪 Copilot Prompt Usage

This game was developed with the help of GitHub Copilot. Prompts were used for:

- Creating the HTML grid layout  
- Styling the game and mole  
- Random mole logic with `setInterval`  
- Score and timer functionality  
- Reset and game over screen logic

Each prompt helped in iterating and improving the core game logic while maintaining clean code structure.

## ✨ Reflection

This project helped reinforce my understanding of DOM manipulation, event listeners, `setInterval`, and real-time UI feedback using just JavaScript. The mole animation, responsive design, and logic timers made the game fun to build and play!
